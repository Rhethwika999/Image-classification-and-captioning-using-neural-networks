# Image Classification and Captioning using neural networks

## Aim
The aim of this project is to develop a comprehensive system that can classify images into predefined categories and generate descriptive captions for the images.

## Objectives
### Image Classification
- **Objective**: To accurately classify images into their respective categories using a deep learning model.
- **Built Using**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

### Image Captioning
- **Objective**: To generate meaningful captions for images using a combination of CNNs and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
- **Built Using**: CNNs for feature extraction and RNNs for sequence generation

## Dataset Details
- **Image Classification Dataset**: [Specify the dataset used, e.g., CIFAR-10, ImageNet]
- **Image Captioning Dataset**: [Specify the dataset used, e.g., MS COCO, Flickr8k]

## Libraries and Packages Used
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the neural networks
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization
- **OpenCV**: For image processing
- **NLTK**: For natural language processing tasks

## Methodology
### Image Classification
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load and preprocess the images (resizing, normalization).
2. **Model Architecture**: Design a CNN architecture suitable for the classification task.
3. **Training**: Train the model on the training dataset.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model on the validation/test dataset.
5. **Optimization**: Fine-tune the model to improve accuracy.

### Image Captioning
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load images and captions, preprocess the text (tokenization, padding).
2. **Feature Extraction**: Use a pre-trained CNN to extract features from images.
3. **Model Architecture**: Design a combined CNN-RNN architecture for caption generation.
4. **Training**: Train the model using the image features and corresponding captions.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using metrics like BLEU score.
6. **Optimization**: Fine-tune the model to improve caption quality.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup Environment**: Install necessary libraries and packages.
2. **Data Preparation**: Download and preprocess the datasets.
3. **Model Development**:
   - **Image Classification**: Build, train, and evaluate the CNN model.
   - **Image Captioning**: Build, train, and evaluate the CNN-RNN model.
4. **Testing**: Test the models on new images to verify their performance.
5. **Deployment**: Deploy the models for real-time image classification and captioning.
